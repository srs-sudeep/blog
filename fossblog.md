# Experience‚úåÔ∏è 
I was able to connect with many seasoned individuals through this event, including my mentors and peers who supported me in various ways. They not only gave me direction, but they also inspired me to press on when I was about to give up. In addition to the standard courses I'm taking, I also learnt how to manage my time and commit it to this project. Learning about and using new technologies, like web sockets, was an interesting journey. I worked along with a few of my peers, which allowed me to explore more and made studying enjoyable and simple. I now have renewed trust in my web programming abilities because to Foss Overflow.
